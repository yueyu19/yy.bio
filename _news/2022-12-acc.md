Our paper "[Cost Design in Atomic Routing Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01221)" and "[Online Poisoning Attacks Against Data-Driven Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09108)" has been accepted for publication in 2023 American Control Conference. Our paper "[Inverse Matrix Games With Unique Quantal Response Equilibrium](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9920011)", which was published in IEEE Control Systems Letters earlier, has been accepted for presentation in the same Conference.
