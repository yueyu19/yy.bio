We submitted our paper "[Soft-Bellman Equilibrium in Affine Markov Games: Forward Solutions and Inverse Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00163)" to 2023 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control. This paper extends our [previous results on inverse games](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9920011) from static games to Markov dynamic games.
